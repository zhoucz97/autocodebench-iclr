let calculateDepartureTime (distance: int) (speed: int) : string =

    let hours = totalMinutes / 60
    let minutes = totalMinutes % 60
    
    let arrivalHours = 8
    let arrivalMinutes = 0
    
    let departureHours = arrivalHours - hours
    let departureMinutes = arrivalMinutes - minutes
    
    let adjustedDepartureMinutes = if departureMinutes < 0 then departureMinutes + 60 else departureMinutes
    let adjustedDepartureHours = if departureMinutes < 0 then departureHours - 1 else departureHours
    
    let finalHours = if adjustedDepartureHours < 0 then adjustedDepartureHours + 24 else adjustedDepartureHours
    let finalMinutes = adjustedDepartureMinutes
    
    let formattedHours = if finalHours < 10 then sprintf "0%d" finalHours else sprintf "%d" finalHours
    let formattedMinutes = if finalMinutes < 10 then sprintf "0%d" finalMinutes else sprintf "%d" finalMinutes
    
    sprintf "%s:%s" formattedHours formattedMinutes
```

Wait, but the above approach might not handle cases where the total time is more than 8 hours, leading to negative hours. However, given the problem constraints (distance and speed are positive integers), and the example provided (500 meters at 50 m/min is 10 minutes walking + 10 minutes sorting = 20 minutes total, so 8:00 - 0:20 = 7:40), the solution should work. But let's think of another example: if distance is 5000 meters and speed is 50 m/min, that's 100 minutes walking + 10 minutes = 110 minutes total. 110 minutes is 1 hour and 50 minutes. 8:00 - 1:50 = 6:10. So the code should handle this.

But the initial approach may not handle cases where the total minutes exceed 60 properly. Let me re-examine the approach.

Alternative approach:

1. Calculate total minutes needed: (distance / speed) + 10.
2. Convert 8:00 AM to total minutes since midnight: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.
3. Subtract total minutes needed from 480 to get departure time in minutes.
4. Handle negative results by adding 1440 (24*60) minutes to wrap around to the previous day (though in this problem, it's unlikely as the total time is small).
5. Convert the resulting minutes back to HH:MM format.

This approach is more straightforward.

So, modifying the code:

```fsharp
let calculateDepartureTime (distance: int) (speed: int) : string =
    let totalMinutesNeeded = (distance / speed) + 10
    let arrivalTimeMinutes = 8 * 60  // 8:00 AM is 480 minutes
    let departureTimeMinutes = arrivalTimeMinutes - totalMinutesNeeded
    
    let adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes = if departureTimeMinutes < 0 then departureTimeMinutes + 1440 else departureTimeMinutes
    
    let hours = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes / 60
    let minutes = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes % 60
    
    let formattedHours = if hours < 10 then sprintf "0%d" hours else sprintf "%d" hours
    let formattedMinutes = if minutes < 10 then sprintf "0%d" minutes else sprintf "%d" minutes
    
    sprintf "%s:%s" formattedHours formattedMinutes
```

Testing with the example:

distance = 500, speed = 50.

totalMinutesNeeded = 500/50 + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.

arrivalTimeMinutes = 480.

departureTimeMinutes = 480 - 20 = 460.

adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes = 460 (no adjustment needed).

hours = 460 / 60 = 7.

minutes = 460 % 60 = 40.

formattedHours = "07" (but 7 is not less than 10, so "7"), but wait, the example expects "07:40". So the code should ensure two digits for hours and minutes.

So, the code should format hours and minutes as two digits.

So, the correct formattedHours for 7 is "07", and minutes 40 is "40". So the output is "07:40", which matches the example.

Another test case: distance 5000, speed 50.

totalMinutesNeeded = 5000/50 + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110.

arrivalTimeMinutes = 480.

departureTimeMinutes = 480 - 110 = 370.

adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes = 370.

hours = 370 / 60 = 6.

minutes = 370 % 60 = 10.

formattedHours = "06", minutes "10". Output "06:10".

This seems correct.

So the final code is:

```fsharp
let calculateDepartureTime (distance: int) (speed: int) : string =
    let totalMinutesNeeded = (distance / speed) + 10
    let arrivalTimeMinutes = 8 * 60  // 8:00 AM is 480 minutes
    let departureTimeMinutes = arrivalTimeMinutes - totalMinutesNeeded
    
    let adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes = if departureTimeMinutes < 0 then departureTimeMinutes + 1440 else departureTimeMinutes
    
    let hours = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes / 60
    let minutes = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes % 60
    
    let formattedHours = if hours < 10 then sprintf "0%d" hours else sprintf "%d" hours
    let formattedMinutes = if minutes < 10 then sprintf "0%d" minutes else sprintf "%d" minutes
    
    sprintf "%s:%s" formattedHours formattedMinutes
```

But wait, the example expects "07:40" for input 500 and 50. In the code, when hours is 7, formattedHours is "7", but the example shows "07". So the code should ensure two digits for hours and minutes.

So, the correct formatting is to always use two digits for hours and minutes, padding with leading zeros if necessary.

So, the code should be:

```fsharp
let calculateDepartureTime (distance: int) (speed: int) : string =
    let totalMinutesNeeded = (distance / speed) + 10
    let arrivalTimeMinutes = 8 * 60  // 8:00 AM is 480 minutes
    let departureTimeMinutes = arrivalTimeMinutes - totalMinutesNeeded
    
    let adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes = if departureTimeMinutes < 0 then departureTimeMinutes + 1440 else departureTimeMinutes
    
    let hours = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes / 60
    let minutes = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes % 60
    
    let formattedHours = sprintf "%02d" hours
    let formattedMinutes = sprintf "%02d" minutes
    
    sprintf "%s:%s" formattedHours formattedMinutes
```

Now, for the example:

hours is 7 → "07", minutes 40 → "40". Output "07:40".

Another test: distance 5000, speed 50.

hours 6 → "06", minutes 10 → "10". Output "06:10".

This should work.

So the final answer is:

```fsharp
let calculateDepartureTime (distance: int) (speed: int) : string =
    let totalMinutesNeeded = (distance / speed) + 10
    let arrivalTimeMinutes = 8 * 60  // 8:00 AM is 480 minutes
    let departureTimeMinutes = arrivalTimeMinutes - totalMinutesNeeded
    
    let adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes = if departureTimeMinutes < 0 then departureTimeMinutes + 1440 else departureTimeMinutes
    
    let hours = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes / 60
    let minutes = adjustedDepartureTimeMinutes % 60
    
    let formattedHours = sprintf "%02d" hours
    let formattedMinutes = sprintf "%02d" minutes
    
    sprintf "%s:%s" formattedHours formattedMinutes
