                    tempDp.[w] <- tempDp.[w - weight] + value
        // Update the main DP array with the best values from this group
        for w = 0 to totalWeight do
            if tempDp.[w] > dp.[w] then

    dp.[totalWeight]
```

Wait, but this approach might not correctly handle the mutual exclusivity within each group. Let me think again. The correct approach should be:

For each group, we need to consider each item in the group as a possible selection, and for each possible weight up to the totalWeight, we choose the best item in the group that maximizes the value without exceeding the weight. Then, we update the DP array accordingly.

Here's the corrected approach:

1. **Initialize DP array**: `dp[i]` represents the maximum value achievable with weight `i`.
2. **Process each group**: For each group, we create a temporary DP array. For each item in the group, we update the temporary DP array by considering the item's weight and value, but only if it improves the value for a particular weight.
3. **Merge results**: After processing all items in a group, we merge the results back into the main DP array, ensuring that only the best value for each weight is kept.

Here's the corrected code:

```fsharp
let maxGroupedKnapsackValue (totalWeight: int) (items: (int * int * int) list) =
    // Group items by their group number
    let groupedItems = 
        items 
        |> List.groupBy (fun (_, _, group) -> group)
        |> List.map (fun (group, itemsInGroup) -> 
            itemsInGroup 
            |> List.map (fun (weight, value, _) -> (weight, value)))
    
    // Initialize DP array: dp[i] is the max value for weight i
    let dp = Array.create (totalWeight + 1) 0
    
    // Process each group
    for group in groupedItems do
        // Create a temporary array to store intermediate results
        let tempDp = Array.copy dp
        for (weight, value) in group do
            for w = totalWeight downto weight do
                if dp.[w - weight] + value > tempDp.[w] then
                    tempDp.[w] <- dp.[w - weight] + value
        // Update the main DP array with the best values from this group
        for w = 0 to totalWeight do
            if tempDp.[w] > dp.[w] then
                dp.[w] <- tempDp.[w]
    
    dp.[totalWeight]
```

Wait, but this still might not handle the mutual exclusivity correctly. Let me think of an example.

Example from the problem:
totalWeight = 50
items = [(10, 60, 1), (20, 100, 1), (30, 120, 2)]

Groups:
Group 1: [(10, 60), (20, 100)]
Group 2: [(30, 120)]

Processing Group 1:
- For each item in Group 1, we update the DP array.
  - Item (10, 60): For weights from 50 down to 10, dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-10] + 60).
  - Item (20, 100): Similarly, for weights from 50 down to 20, dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-20] + 100).
After processing Group 1, the DP array will have the best values considering either item from Group 1 (but not both, because they are in the same group).

Then, processing Group 2:
- Item (30, 120): For weights from 50 down to 30, dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-30] + 120).
The final DP[50] will be the maximum value achievable, which in this case is 220 (selecting 20 from Group 1 and 30 from Group 2).

So the code should work. Let me test the example.

Initial dp is all zeros.

Processing Group 1:
Item (10, 60):
- w=50: dp[50] = max(0, dp[40] + 60) = 60
- w=40: dp[40] = max(0, dp[30] + 60) = 60
...
- w=10: dp[10] = 60

Item (20, 100):
- w=50: dp[50] = max(60, dp[30] + 100) = max(60, 0 + 100) = 100
- w=40: dp[40] = max(60, dp[20] + 100) = max(60, 0 + 100) = 100
- w=30: dp[30] = max(60, dp[10] + 100) = max(60, 60 + 100) = 160
- w=20: dp[20] = max(0, dp[0] + 100) = 100

After Group 1, dp is:
dp[10] = 60
dp[20] = 100
dp[30] = 160
dp[40] = 100
dp[50] = 100

Processing Group 2:
Item (30, 120):
- w=50: dp[50] = max(100, dp[20] + 120) = max(100, 100 + 120) = 220
- w=40: dp[40] = max(100, dp[10] + 120) = max(100, 60 + 120) = 180
- w=30: dp[30] = max(160, dp[0] + 120) = max(160, 120) = 160

Final dp[50] is 220, which matches the example.

So the code is correct.

Thus, the function is:

```fsharp
let maxGroupedKnapsackValue (totalWeight: int) (items: (int * int * int) list) =
    // Group items by their group number
    let groupedItems = 
        items 
        |> List.groupBy (fun (_, _, group) -> group)
        |> List.map (fun (group, itemsInGroup) -> 
            itemsInGroup 
            |> List.map (fun (weight, value, _) -> (weight, value)))
    
    // Initialize DP array: dp[i] is the max value for weight i
    let dp = Array.create (totalWeight + 1) 0
    
    // Process each group
    for group in groupedItems do
        // Create a temporary array to store intermediate results
        let tempDp = Array.copy dp
        for (weight, value) in group do
            for w = totalWeight downto weight do
                if dp.[w - weight] + value > tempDp.[w] then
                    tempDp.[w] <- dp.[w - weight] + value
        // Update the main DP array with the best values from this group
        for w = 0 to totalWeight do
            if tempDp.[w] > dp.[w] then
                dp.[w] <- tempDp.[w]
    
    dp.[totalWeight]

    let test5 = maxGroupedKnapsackValue 30 [(5, 10, 1); (10, 20, 1); (15, 30, 2)]
    if test5 <> 50 then
        failwithf "Test Case 5 failed: Expected 50, got %d" test5
