                while i < n && sortedStalls.[i] - sortedStalls.[index] < minDist do

            let mid = (left + right) / 2
            if canPlace mid 1 0 then
                binarySearch (mid + 1) right
            else
                binarySearch left (mid - 1)
    binarySearch 1 (sortedStalls.[n - 1] - sortedStalls.[0])
```

Wait, but the above code might have some issues. Let me re-examine the approach and correct the implementation.

The correct approach should involve:

1. Sorting the stalls.
2. Performing binary search between 0 and the maximum possible distance (last stall - first stall).
3. For each mid value, check if it's possible to place all cows with at least mid distance between them.
4. The feasibility check involves placing the first cow at the first stall, then placing subsequent cows at the earliest possible stall that is at least mid distance away from the last placed cow.

Here's the corrected F# function:

```fsharp
let maximumMinimumDistance (stalls: int list) (cows: int) : int =
    let sortedStalls = List.sort stalls
    let n = List.length sortedStalls
    if n < cows then 0 else
    let canPlace minDist =
        let mutable count = 1
        let mutable lastPos = sortedStalls.[0]
        for i in 1 .. n - 1 do
            if sortedStalls.[i] - lastPos >= minDist then
                count <- count + 1
                lastPos <- sortedStalls.[i]
                if count = cows then true
        count >= cows
    let rec binarySearch left right =
        if left > right then right
        else
            let mid = (left + right) / 2
            if canPlace mid then
                binarySearch (mid + 1) right
            else
                binarySearch left (mid - 1)
    binarySearch 1 (sortedStalls.[n - 1] - sortedStalls.[0])
```

Wait, but the initial code had a different approach for the canPlace function. Let me think again.

The canPlace function should check if we can place 'cows' cows with at least 'minDist' distance between them. The algorithm is:

1. Place the first cow at the first stall.
2. For each subsequent cow, find the next stall that is at least 'minDist' away from the last placed cow.
3. If we can place all cows this way, return true; otherwise, false.

So the canPlace function should be:

```fsharp
let canPlace minDist =
    let mutable count = 1
    let mutable lastPos = sortedStalls.[0]
    for i in 1 .. n - 1 do
        if sortedStalls.[i] - lastPos >= minDist then
            count <- count + 1
            lastPos <- sortedStalls.[i]
            if count = cows then true
    count >= cows
```

But in F#, the for loop doesn't return early. So we need to use a different approach, like a while loop or a recursive function.

Here's the corrected version using a while loop:

```fsharp
let maximumMinimumDistance (stalls: int list) (cows: int) : int =
    let sortedStalls = List.sort stalls
    let n = List.length sortedStalls
    if n < cows then 0 else
    let canPlace minDist =
        let mutable count = 1
        let mutable lastPos = sortedStalls.[0]
        let mutable i = 1
        while i < n && count < cows do
            if sortedStalls.[i] - lastPos >= minDist then
                count <- count + 1
                lastPos <- sortedStalls.[i]
            i <- i + 1
        count >= cows
    let rec binarySearch left right =
        if left > right then right
        else
            let mid = (left + right) / 2
            if canPlace mid then
                binarySearch (mid + 1) right
            else
                binarySearch left (mid - 1)
    binarySearch 1 (sortedStalls.[n - 1] - sortedStalls.[0])
```

This should work. Let's test the examples:

Example 1:
stalls = [1; 2; 4; 8; 9], cows = 3.
Sorted stalls: [1; 2; 4; 8; 9].
Maximum possible distance is 9 - 1 = 8.
Binary search will find the maximum minDist where canPlace returns true.

For minDist = 3:
- Place first cow at 1.
- Next cow at 4 (distance 3).
- Next cow at 8 (distance 4).
Total cows placed: 3. So canPlace returns true.
Then we try larger values until the maximum is found.

Example 2:
stalls = [1; 3; 5; 7; 9; 11], cows = 4.
Sorted stalls: [1; 3; 5; 7; 9; 11].
Maximum possible distance is 11 - 1 = 10.
For minDist = 2:
- Place first cow at 1.
- Next at 3 (distance 2).
- Next at 5 (distance 2).
- Next at 7 (distance 2).
Total cows placed: 4. So canPlace returns true.
Larger values like 3 would not allow placing 4 cows (e.g., 1, 4, 7, 10 â€” but 10 is not in the list, so only 1,4,7, which is 3 cows). So the maximum is 2.

Thus, the function should return the correct values for these examples.

So the final F# function is:

```fsharp
let maximumMinimumDistance (stalls: int list) (cows: int) : int =
    let sortedStalls = List.sort stalls
    let n = List.length sortedStalls
    if n < cows then 0 else
    let canPlace minDist =
        let mutable count = 1
        let mutable lastPos = sortedStalls.[0]
        let mutable i = 1
        while i < n && count < cows do
            if sortedStalls.[i] - lastPos >= minDist then
                count <- count + 1
                lastPos <- sortedStalls.[i]
            i <- i + 1
        count >= cows
    let rec binarySearch left right =
        if left > right then right
        else
            let mid = (left + right) / 2
            if canPlace mid then
                binarySearch (mid + 1) right
            else
                binarySearch left (mid - 1)
    binarySearch 1 (sortedStalls.[n - 1] - sortedStalls.[0])


let check () =
    if maximumMinimumDistance [1; 2; 4; 8; 9] 3 <> 3 then
        failwith "Test Case 1 failed"
    if maximumMinimumDistance [1; 3; 5; 7; 9; 11] 4 <> 2 then
        failwith "Test Case 2 failed"
    if maximumMinimumDistance [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10] 5 <> 2 then
        failwith "Test Case 3 failed"
    if maximumMinimumDistance [10; 20; 30; 40; 50] 2 <> 40 then
        failwith "Test Case 4 failed"
    if maximumMinimumDistance [5; 15; 25; 35; 45; 55; 65; 75; 85; 95] 3 <> 40 then
        failwith "Test Case 5 failed"
