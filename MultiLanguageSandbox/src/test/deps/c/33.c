This problem introduces a new modulo operation, denoted by the symbol "⊕". When calculating x ⊕ y, if x is not a multiple of y, the result is the remainder of x divided by y. Otherwise, divide x by y repeatedly until x is no longer a multiple of y, denoting the final value as x'. Then the result is the remainder of x' divided by y. For example, 4⊕5=4, 20⊕5=4, 100⊕5=4.
Given a prime number p, there will be several queries. For each query, an integer n is given, and you need to compute the value of n! ⊕ p, where n! is the factorial of n, i.e., the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

unsigned long long newModuloFactorial(unsigned long long n, unsigned long long p) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1 % p; // 0 or 1 is 1, then 1 ⊕ p is 1 % p
    }
    
    // Step 1: Compute the exponent e of p in n (number of times p divides n!)
    unsigned long long e = 0;
    unsigned long long temp = n;
    while (temp > 0) {
        temp /= p;
        e += temp;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Compute n mod p^(e+1)
    unsigned long long mod = 1;
    for (unsigned long long i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        mod = (mod * i) % (p * p); // This is a simplification; need to compute mod p^(e+1)
    }
    // The above loop is incorrect for large e. Instead, we need to compute mod p^(e+1).
    // However, for the purpose of this problem, we can proceed under the assumption that e is small or the factorial mod p^(e+1) can be computed correctly.
    // But in practice, for large n and p, this approach may not work due to overflow. Hence, a better approach is needed.
    
    // Alternative approach: compute the product without the factors of p, then multiply by p^e, then divide by p^e in the custom operation.
    // But given the constraints, we might need a different method.
    
    // For the sample input (3, 7), 3 = 6, 6 ⊕ 7 is 6 % 7 = 6, which matches the sample output.
    // So the function should return 6 for newModuloFactorial(3, 7).
    
    // However, the general solution requires more steps. Here's a corrected approach:
    
    // Compute the product of all numbers from 1 to n, excluding the factors of p, then multiply by p^e, then apply the custom mod.
    // But since the custom mod is (x / p^e) % p if x is divisible by p^e, otherwise x % p.
    // So, the steps are:
    // 1. Compute the exponent e of p in n.
    // 2. Compute the product of all numbers from 1 to n, divided by p^e (i.e., remove all factors of p).
    // 3. Multiply this product by p^e to get n.
    // 4. Apply the custom mod: if n is divisible by p, then divide by p until not, then mod p.
    // But since we've already removed p^e, the remaining product is not divisible by p, so the custom mod is (product * p^e) mod p = (product mod p) * (p^e mod p) mod p.
    // But p^e mod p is 0 if e >=1. So the result is 0 if e >=1 and product mod p is not zero. But wait, no:
    // The custom mod is (n / p^e) mod p, because after removing p^e, the remaining is not divisible by p.
    // So the answer is ( (product_without_p_factors) mod p ) * (p^e mod p) mod p. But p^e mod p is 0 if e >=1. So the product is zero unless e=0.
    // But e is the exponent of p in n!, so if e >=1, then the answer is 0 mod p =0. But the sample input has e=0 (since 7 does not divide 6), so the answer is 6 mod 7=6.
    
    // So the general solution is:
    // 1. Compute e, the exponent of p in n.
    // 2. If e ==0, then n mod p is the answer.
    // 3. Else, the answer is 0.
    
    // But the sample input (3,7) has e=0 (7 does not divide 6), so 6 mod 7=6. Correct.
    // Another example: n=5, p=5. 5 =120. 120 ⊕5: 120 is divisible by 5, so divide by 5 to get 24, then 24 mod5=4. So the answer is 4.
    // According to the approach: e is the exponent of 5 in 5 =1 (5/5 +5/25=1). So e=1. Then the answer is (product_without_5_factors * 5^1) mod5. The product without 5 factors is 1*2*3*4*1 (since 5 is replaced by 1 after removing one factor of 5). So 24 mod5=4. Correct.
    
    // So the correct approach is:
    // 1. Compute e, the exponent of p in n.
    // 2. Compute the product of all numbers from 1 to n, but for each multiple of p, divide it by p once (only once per multiple, not recursively), then multiply them together. This gives product = (n / p^e) * something. Wait, no.
    // Actually, the product without the factors of p is the product of all numbers from 1 to n, where each multiple of p is divided by p once (only once per occurrence, not recursively). Then, the total product is (this product) * p^e. Then, the custom mod is (this product) mod p, because after dividing by p^e, the remaining is not divisible by p.
    
    // So the steps are:
    // a. Compute e, the exponent of p in n (sum of n/p + n/p^2 + ...).
    // b. Compute the product P of all numbers from 1 to n, where for each multiple of p, we divide it by p once (only once per multiple). For example, for n=5, p=5: numbers are 1,2,3,4,5. 5 is a multiple of 5, so we use 5/5=1. So P=1*2*3*4*1=24. Then, P mod p =24 mod5=4. Which matches the expected result.
    // c. The answer is P mod p.
    
    // So the function can be implemented as:
    unsigned long long e = 0;
    unsigned long long temp_n = n;
    while (temp_n > 0) {
        temp_n /= p;
        e += temp_n;
    }
    
    unsigned long long product = 1;
    for (unsigned long long i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        unsigned long long num = i;
        while (num % p == 0 && e > 0) {
            num /= p;
            e--;
        }
        product = (product * num) % p;
    }
    
    return product;
}

// The above function should work for the sample input and other cases.
// For example, newModuloFactorial(3,7):
// e is 0 (7 does not divide 3 =6).
// product is 1*2*3=6 mod7=6. Correct.
// Another test case: n=5, p=5:
// e is 1 (5/5=1).
// product: numbers 1,2,3,4,5. 5 is divided by 5 once: 1. So product is 1*2*3*4*1=24 mod5=4. Correct.
