function bacteria_distribution(initial_count::Int, days::Int) :: Array{Int, 2}
    """
    Compute the distribution of bacteria in a 9x9 petri dish over a specified number of days. Initially, a given number of bacteria are placed in the center of the dish. Suppose a bacterium lives only one day. Each day, each bacterium produces 10 offspring. Two of these remain in the original cell, while the other eight are evenly distributed among the adjacent cells.

    # Examples
    - `bacteria_distribution(2, 1)` results in a 9x9 matrix with certain cells having bacteria counts.
    - `bacteria_distribution(3, 2)` will show the spread of bacteria after 2 days starting from 3 bacteria.

    The function returns a 9x9 matrix representing the bacteria distribution in the dish.
