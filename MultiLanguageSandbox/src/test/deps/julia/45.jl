function max_product_partition(n::Int, m::Int) :: Vector{Int}
    """
    Find `m` positive integers whose sum is `n`, and their product is as large as possible. Return the partition in lexicographically smallest order.

    # Examples
    - `max_product_partition(6, 3)` should return `[2, 2, 2]` because 2*2*2 is the largest product you can get from three numbers that add up to 6.
    - `max_product_partition(8, 3)` should return `[2, 3, 3]` since 2*3*3 = 18 is the largest product from three numbers that add up to 8.

    # Arguments
    - `n`: The sum of the numbers.
    - `m`: The number of positive integers.

    # Returns
    - A vector of integers representing the partition.
