    Determine the number of whole apples remaining after eating them over a given period.

    Yuki loves eating apples and can finish one in `t` minutes, immediately starting the next one after finishing. Given `m` apples and a period of `s` minutes, calculate how many whole apples remain.

    # Examples
    - `remaining_apples(50, 10, 200)` returns `30`.
    - `remaining_apples(5, 5, 20)` returns `1`.
