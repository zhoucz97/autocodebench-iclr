    Calculate the minimum number of moves required to solve the double-disc Hanoi Towers problem for n pairs of discs.
    
    This function implements an iterative algorithm to determine the minimum number of moves necessary to transfer
    2n discs from the A pole to the C pole in a double-disc Hanoi Towers setup, following the rules that only one disc 
    can be moved at a time and no disc may be placed on top of a smaller disc. The function uses a known recursive relation 
    and iteratively computes the total number of moves for n pairs of discs.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of disc pairs (each of two identical discs) on the A pole.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of moves required to transfer all the discs from the A pole to the C pole.

    Cases:
    - For n=1, the function should return 2.
    - For n=2, the function should return 6.
    - For n=3, the function should return 14.
