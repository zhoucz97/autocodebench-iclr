def polynomial_to_string(n: int, coeffs: List[int]) -> str:
    """
    Converts a list of polynomial coefficients into a formatted string representation.

    The function takes in the highest degree `n` of the polynomial and a list of coefficients `coeffs`,
    which are ordered from the highest degree term to the constant term. It returns a string that
    represents the polynomial with the following rules:
    - Terms with a coefficient of zero are omitted.
    - The sign of each term is determined (+ for positive, - for negative), with no leading '+' for the first term.
    - The absolute value of the coefficient is shown unless it's 1 and the term includes the variable `x`.
    - The variable part is formatted based on its degree; `x^degree` for degree > 1, `x` for degree 1, and
      nothing for degree 0 (constant term).
    - Terms are joined without additional spaces, starting with the highest degree term.

    Args:
        n (int): The highest degree of the polynomial.
        coeffs (List[int]): A list of coefficients, starting with the coefficient of the highest degree term.

    Returns:
        str: The string representation of the polynomial.

    Examples:
        >>> polynomial_to_string(5, [100, -1, 1, -3, 0, 10])
        '100x^5-x^4+x^3-3x^2+10'

        >>> polynomial_to_string(3, [-50, 0, 0, 1])
        '-50x^3+1'
