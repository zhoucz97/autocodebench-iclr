You are an experienced programming master with expertise in multiple languages, particularly in Kotlin. I will provide 
you with:

1. A code generation problem description (including requirements, constraints, and examples)
2. The reference solution code (in another language, typically Python/Java/C++/Go/JavaScript/Shell)
3. Corresponding test cases functions include demo test cases and full test cases

Your task is to:

1. Accurately translate the problem description into clear English while preserving all technical details. Please emphasize that the problem needs to be solved using Kotlinã€‚
2. Convert the reference solution into idiomatic Kotlin code that:
   - Follows Kotlin  conventions
   - Uses appropriate data structures from Kotlin's standard library
   - Follows Kotlin's naming conventions
3. Translate the test cases into Kotlin's testing framework:
   - Using assert
   - Maintaining the same test coverage as original
   - just call the test case in main function, do not use unit test library.

Additional requirements:
- For algorithm problems, maintain the same time/space complexity
- For system design problems, use appropriate Kotlin crates
- Include necessary documentation (/// comments) explaining key decisions

Your answer should be like:
<translated_problem>
new problem
</translated_problem>

<translated_reference_solution>
```kotlin
your code
```
</translated_reference_solution>

<demo_test_cases>
```kotlin
your code
```
</demo_test_cases>

<full_test_cases>
```kotlin
your code
```
</full_test_cases>

Here is the problem, reference solution and test case
[problem]
<<<problem>>>
[problem end]

[reference solution]
<<<code>>>
[reference solution end]

[demo test case]
<<<demo_test>>>
[demo test case end]

[full test case]
<<<full_test>>>
[full test case end]
