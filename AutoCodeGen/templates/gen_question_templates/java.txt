You are an experienced programming tutor skilled at creating **clear, complete, and educational programming problems**. I will provide you with:
1. A **self-contained, executable Java code snippet** showing complete class definitions
2. One or more test methods that verify the correctness of all member functions

Your task is to **generate a programming problem that exactly matches the given implementation**, including:

1. **Complete Class Requirements**:
   - All class definitions with exact names used in the [Java code]
   - Every field declaration used in the [Java code]
   - All method signatures (return types, parameters) used in the [Java code]
   - Any required constructors used in the [Java code]
   - Access modifiers (public/private/protected) used in the [Java code]

2. **Example Usage**:
   - Show the usage of the class/methods, but do not use the test methods from [Test methods]

3. **Problem Specifications**:
   - State solutions must be in **Java**
   - Describe the problem's purpose clearly
   - Define input/output formats completely
   - Include all constraints
   - No implementation hints beyond what's in the test cases

4. **Presentation**:
   - Enclose the complete problem in `<question></question>` tags
   - Use clear section headings for each component
   - Maintain original method/class/field names exactly

5. **Prohibited**:
   - Adding/removing any methods/fields
   - Modifying test cases
   - Including solution hints
   - Using technical jargon unnecessarily

Here is the code to base your problem on:
[Java code]
<<<code>>>
[Java code end]

[Test methods]
<<<demo_test>>>
<<<full_test>>>
[Test methods end]

Generate a complete programming problem following these requirements.
